Title: Ingest & Store Real-Time Telemetry from Power Converters via IoT Protocols

Opening (0–5 min)
[Slide: Title + Abstract]
“Good morning/afternoon everyone! Thank you for joining this tutorial on Ingesting and Storing Real-Time Telemetry from Power Converters using IoT Protocols.
Why is this important? Power-electronic converters—like grid-tied inverters, DC–DC modules, and EV drives—generate rich telemetry streams: voltage, current, temperature, and switching states. Capturing these signals in real time is critical for adaptive control, energy efficiency, and early fault detection.
But here’s the challenge:

Harsh EMI environments
Kilohertz sampling rates
Need for secure, lightweight transport
Scalable storage for analytics

Today, I’ll show you how to build an open-source pipeline using MQTT, Apache Kafka, and TimescaleDB that achieves sub-200 ms latency at ≥10 kHz sample rates. We’ll also cover real-time feature extraction, dashboards, and ML integration.”

Section 1: Edge Telemetry Collection (5–15 min)
[Slide: MQTT Architecture]
“At the edge, converters publish telemetry using MQTT, a lightweight pub/sub protocol ideal for IoT.
Key points:

QoS 1 ensures at-least-once delivery.
TLS 1.3 secures data in transit.
X.509 certificates authenticate devices.

We also implement local buffering and backfill strategies so data isn’t lost during network outages.
Demo:

Show MQTT client publishing voltage/current data at 10 kHz.
Highlight EMQX broker clustering and certificate-based security.”


Section 2: Transport & Buffering with Kafka (15–25 min)
[Slide: MQTT → Kafka Bridge]
“Next, we need a fault-tolerant backbone. Enter Apache Kafka.
Why Kafka?

Horizontal scalability
Persistent log for replay
High throughput

We use Kafka Connect to bridge MQTT topics into a 3-node Kafka cluster. This setup sustained 12.9 MB/s ingest in our pilot.
Demo:

Show message flow from MQTT → Kafka topics.
Explain partitioning for parallel processing.”


Section 3: Real-Time Stream Processing (25–35 min)
[Slide: ksqlDB Queries]
“Raw telemetry is great, but we need actionable insights.
Using ksqlDB, we perform:

Windowed aggregations for THD and dv/dt peaks.
Anomaly scoring for predictive maintenance.

Demo:

Run a ksqlDB query to compute THD in real time.
Show anomaly alerts published to a Kafka topic.”


Section 4: Time-Series Storage (35–45 min)
[Slide: TimescaleDB Hypertables]
“Processed data flows into TimescaleDB, a PostgreSQL extension optimized for time-series data.
Features:

Hypertables for high-velocity inserts.
Continuous aggregates for fast queries.
Retention and compression policies to control storage costs.

Demo:

Insert telemetry into TimescaleDB.
Query historical THD trends efficiently.”


Section 5: Visualization & ML Integration (45–55 min)
[Slide: Grafana Dashboard]
“Finally, we visualize and integrate with ML workflows.

Grafana/Tableau for live dashboards.
Python API for batch export and model retraining.

Demo:

Show Grafana dashboard with real-time THD and anomaly alerts.
Briefly outline ML retraining pipeline for predictive maintenance.”


Closing & Q&A (55–60 min)
[Slide: Key Takeaways]
“To wrap up:

We built an open-source IoT pipeline: MQTT → Kafka → TimescaleDB → Grafana.
Achieved sub-200 ms latency and 25 min earlier fault alerts compared to SCADA.
This architecture enables smarter grid integration and predictive maintenance.
