Harsh EMI Environments

What it means: Power-electronic converters operate in environments with strong electromagnetic interference (EMI) due to high switching frequencies and large currents.
Impact: EMI can corrupt data signals, cause packet loss, and disrupt wireless communication.
Solution: Use shielded cabling, proper grounding, and protocols resilient to interference (e.g., MQTT over TLS with retries and QoS). Edge buffering helps prevent data loss during transient outages.


2. Kilohertz Sampling Rates

What it means: Telemetry from converters often needs to capture fast-changing electrical signals (voltage, current) at rates like 10 kHz or higher.
Impact: High sampling rates generate large data volumes—tens of MB/s per device—which stresses network bandwidth and storage systems.
Solution: Lightweight protocols (MQTT) for efficient transport, and stream processing (Kafka + ksqlDB) to aggregate or downsample data before storage.


3. Secure, Lightweight Transport

What it means: Data must be transmitted securely without adding heavy overhead that could increase latency or reduce throughput.
Impact: Traditional protocols like HTTP are too heavy for real-time telemetry; insecure transport risks data tampering or unauthorized access.
Solution: MQTT with TLS 1.3 encryption and X.509 certificate-based authentication provides confidentiality and integrity while remaining lightweight.


4. Scalable Storage

What it means: Telemetry pipelines must handle billions of time-stamped records efficiently for both real-time dashboards and historical analysis.
Impact: A standard relational database will struggle with high ingest rates and time-series queries.
Solution: Use time-series databases like TimescaleDB or InfluxDB, which support hypertables, compression, and retention policies for cost-effective scalability.
